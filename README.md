This is the final project for course: GR5702 Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization course offered at Columbia University in Spring 2021. The project is a collaborate work of Shiyue Liu, Zhengyi(Skye) Chen and Shengyuan Cao. 


### Abstract

This study focuses on examining transportation and pandemic statistics, which ties to people's mobility level, with the hope of providing a view of pandemic influence from a different angle. This project performed an exploratory data analysis based on data visualizations.

With the help of data sets describing people's trip behaviors, transportation patterns and pandemic statistics, we utilize thorough visualizations that cover people's trip pattern at both national and state level, discussed the relationship between trips and confirmed cases, in combination with time series representation that captures the trend both prior to and after the outbreak.
