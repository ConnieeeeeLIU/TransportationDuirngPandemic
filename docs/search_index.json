[["index.html", "Transportation during Pandemic Chapter 1 Introduction", " Transportation during Pandemic Shengyuan Cao, Zhengyi Chen and Shiyue Liu 2021-04-12 Chapter 1 Introduction COVID-19 has been an ongoing global pandemic since 2019, reshaping everyone’s life. COVID-19 spreads when infected people interact closely with others. Main effective prevention methods are wearing masks and social distancing, hence quarantine rules and working-from-home policies have been published by the government. Since then, people’s daily mobility patterns have been largely perturbed by the pandemic. However, when people are discussing the influence of COVID-19, they tend to mainly care about the number of confirmed cases. This study focuses on examining transportation and pandemic statistics, which ties to people’s mobility level, with the hope of providing a view of pandemic influence from a different angle. This study took March 13th, 2019 as the start date of COVID-19, in correspondence with Trump’s declaration of COVID-19 a National Emergency. Our research investigates following questions: 1). How many people choose to stay at home and how many trips people take when they are not at home? We are also interested in finding out people’s tendency to take trips in terms of each state. 2). How transportation statistics change before and after the COVID pandemic and to which extent the pandemic is influencing people’s transportation preference? For example, is the distribution of trip distance changed after the pandemic? 3). What is the relationship between people’s trip behavior and the COVID-19 statistics? With the help of data sets describing people’s trip behaviors, transportation patterns and pandemic statistics, we utilize thorough visualizations that cover people’s trip pattern at both national and state level, discussed the relationship between trips and confirmed cases, in combination with time series representation that captures the trend both prior to and after the outbreak. That’s how we hope to answer above questions through this study. "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Dataset 1: Trips by distance 2.2 Dataset 2: Transportation 2.3 Dataset 3: COVID-19 statistics", " Chapter 2 Data sources Our project uses three datasets: Trips by Distance, Transportation, and COVID-19 statistics. The first two datasets are published by U.S. Department of Tranportation, Bureau of Transportation Statistics. The third one is from the covid19.analytics Package. For each dataset, we present a graphs using visdat package (visdat) to visualize the columns and datatypes within the dataset. 2.1 Dataset 1: Trips by distance The Trips by distance dataset is from this website. The travel statistics are produced from an anonymized national panel of mobile device data from multiple sources. All data sources used in the creation of the metrics contain no personal information. The dataset has 2,609,498 observations and 20 columns. It provides insights about the number of people staying at home, not staying at home, and how many trips are made with different miles at national, state and county level on a daily basis. Trips are defined as movements that include a stay of longer than 10 minutes at an anonymized location away from home. Below is the visualization on s subset of this dataset(since the whole dataset contains too many rows). The horizontal axis displays the columns in the data set and the vertical axis represents each observations. Different colors represent the datatype for the column. The trip distances are divided into ten granular levels, for example, less than 1 mile, from 1 to 3 miles, and so on, until the distance above 500 miles. As we can see from above graph, columns contains the number of trips at the corresponding granular distance level, for example, Number of Trips &lt;1 shows number of trips made by residents shorter than one mile. These columns have integer datatype. Level column shows if the observation is on national, state or county level. Column Date is a datetime type recording the exact date of the records. The open datasets are available for downloading as a .csv file directly from the website. We can diectly read these .csv files as dataframes in RStudio. 2.2 Dataset 2: Transportation The Monthly Transportation Statistics dataset is from this website. The Bureau of Transportation Statistics brings together the latest data from across the Federal government and transportation industry. Monthly Transportation Statistics contains over 50 time series from nearly two dozen data sources. Data provides insights about population using different traffic methods at monthly scale. For example, how many people take airplanes in each month. The dataset contains data both before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Since we want to explore how transportation usage are affected by COVID-19, we choose 10 months of data before and after the outbreak of COVID-19 respectively. The subset of dataset can be chosen directly on the website and downloaded, we choose to include 20 observations, each indicating a month. The dataset has 20 rows and 137 columns. One drawback is that there are too many columns and only a small subset of columns are to our interest of analyzing how COVID-19 pandemic affect mobility and transportation. Many irrelevant columns are about transportation fatalities and government construction spending on all kinds of transportation systems. Therefore, when doing data analyze, we remove those columns and select variables which are closely related to our study. Below is the visualization of the subset we took. The majority of columns are of integer datatypes showing the number of people using various transportation methods. The column Date is a date type. The open datasets are available for downloading as a .csv file directly from the website. We can directly read these .csv files as dataframes in RStudio. 2.3 Dataset 3: COVID-19 statistics The COVID-19 statistics dataset is from the covid19.analytics Package. It provides the time series worldwide data for COVID-19 virus from the JHU’s CCSE repository. For our study, we only select the subset of data where the country is the United States and it provide COVID-19 statistics in the state level. Data provides information about the population of getting confirmed or dead due to COVID-19. The dataset has 3277 rows and 14 columns. Below is the visualization of this dataset. As shown in the graph, the Confirmed and Deaths are integer datatypes, and these are the metrics that we used in our following study. Province_State is a character that indicates the state of the records. The open datasets are available in covid19.analytics package and we can directly import the data from the package for further use. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation For the Trips by Distance dataset, we first read the .csv file into R with specific datatypes for each columns. Then, we select observations after 2019-04-01 since we are interested in analyzing one year of data before and after COVID-19. We also convert the Date column to a standardized date format. Since the dataset contains too many observations and is inconvenient to load the data all at once, we decide to split the dataset by National and State level. We create a National.csv and State.csv containing only the time range that we are interested in. We also create a .csv for each state since sometimes we want to dig into the behavior of a specific state, hence we use a for loop to iterate through all states and create a .csv file for each state and create a state folder to organize all the data files. Similarly, we performed the same procedure for each county to create a county folder containing data for each county. For the Transportation dataset, we select a subset of columns, including Fixed Route Busand Urban Rail for transit ridership, International Airline and Domestic Airline for airplane traveling, Intermodal Units and Carloads for freight rail. Since we use the 2020-03-13 as the outbreak point of COVID-19 and data until December 2020 are available on the website, we use 10 months of data before and after the outbreak to see whether various transportation have been influenced. Therefore, we use data from May 2019 to February 2020 as the pre-covid periods, and data from March 2020 to December 2020 as pandemic periods. For each variable of interest, we group data by pre-covid period and pandemic period, then sum up these values to create a new dataframe in order to see if the impact of COVID-19 on different transportation methods. Since many values added up to have very large units, we re-scale the units to be in millions. For example, 10M means 10 million unit, and 100M means 100 million unit. For the COVID-19 statistics, we install covid19.analytics package and read in COVID-19 data in the U.S., which are useful for our analysis. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Dataset1: Trips by distance 4.2 Dataset 2: Transportation data 4.3 Dataset 3: COVID-19 statistics", " Chapter 4 Missing values In this section, we present graphs using visdat package (visdat) to visual the missing patterns of our data sets. We present missing-value visualizations corresponding to each dataset to help readers to have a comprehensive impression on all the data sets. 4.1 Dataset1: Trips by distance As described in section 2, this data set is about the number of trips by distance. Below we show the missing data visualizations. According to the label, the black area indicates the missing value in the data set. The plot shows that all the data for column StateFIPS, State Postal Code, County FIPS and County Name are missing. However, in our project, we do not use these columns hence we can directly omit these columns in our following analysis. For other columns, there are no missing values. 4.2 Dataset 2: Transportation data Similarly, we present the missing value plot for transportation data. Since the dataset contains 137 columns, to better display the result, we only select the columns that are used in our project. The time interval that is between 2019-05-01 to 2020-12-31. The above graph shows that there are no missing values in the data set. 4.3 Dataset 3: COVID-19 statistics Below is the graph for the missing data situation for COVID-19 data set. The graph shows that there are missing values in the FIPS, Recovered, Active, Lat, Long_, Incident_Rate, and Case_fatility_ratio have missing values. However, we only used the Confirmed and Deaths columns in the data hence we can omit these columns for our analysis.

The number of trips that people make on daily basis can be a useful metric to measure people’s mobility level. Among the trips for individual’s daily basis, the commute between home and working place usually takes a huge part of the statistics. Due to the publication of quarantine rules and working from home policy, the commute need largely decreases and people are encouraged to stay at home unless it is essential. Hence, the number of trips on a daily basis is expected to decrease. To investigate how people’s mobility level really behaves and varies, we present the graph for people’s trip numbers at national level from April 2019 to March 2021, which includes data from a year before the COVID-19 outbreak and a year after the pandemic. Above time series plot contains how many daily trips are made nationally, weekly averaged number of trips(blue curve), as well as a smoothed daily trip number to better demonstrate the trend within the time series(pink curve). From the plot, the number of trips in the vertical axis are presented in million unit to reach a better scale. The yellow highlighted rectangular part represents the COVID-19 outbreak in the U.S. after March 13, 2020. From the graph, we can clearly find that the number of trips largely decreased after the pandemic and has a huge drop right after president Trump declare the national emergency, which shows the same trend as expected. From the smoothed daily trip(pink) curve, there is upward trend regarding the number of trips people made nationally since December 2020. In December 2020, the United States begins its public vaccinations, which could be one of the reasons of the increasing trend in trip numbers since people are more tend to make trips after getting vaccinated. Also, the establishment of the vaccine station also requires daily commute trips for doctors and health-workers. Up to March 2020, the number of trips nationally, although has increased a lot comparing with the numbers in the late 2020, however, still lower than the common level before the COVID-19 outbreak. 5.2 Histogram: trip length distribution before and after COVID-19 After having an overall impression on how the total trips number changes, we want to have a close look at how trip numbers with different distance length changes due to COVID-19. Hence, we present following stack histogram in which the height of each stack shows the numbers of trips for different distance category. The distance category is the original data set are: trips below 1 mile, between 1-3 miles, 3-5 miles, 5-10 miles, 10-25 miles, 25-50 miles, 50-100 miles, 100-250 miles, 250-500 miles and above 500 miles. Since the trips with distance longer than 50 miles takes a relatively small percentage comparing with other distance categories, to make it more clear on the histogram and avoid having too much catrgories that can not provide much information, we deicide to combine the number of trips that are above 50 miles to one category called Number of Trips &gt;= 50 and then create the histogram based on the new categories. The total height of the bars represent the total number of trips and the vertical axis is scaled to millions in unit. In the plot, each distance category has a unique color to better show the percentage distribution within the total number of trips before and after the pandemic. The time range for splitting the pandemic is 2020-03-13. The height of the bars decreased from before to after, which shows that the total number of trips decreased after the pandemic. As for the distributions for each distance categories, since the number of trips of each categories decreases and the whole trip number decreases as well, it is not very obvious to see how the percentage of each categories changes. However, we can still find that for the trips above 50 miles, the percentage seems to increase and for trips between 1-3 miles, the percentage decreases. Before examining the data, we are intuitively expecting that long-trip distance is decreased since people can not travel between cities. To have a more rigorous conclusion on how the percentage of each distance categories changes, we provide numerical calculations below. ## # A tibble: 7 x 2 ## distance perc_change ## &lt;fct&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Number of Trips &lt;1 0.0141 ## 2 Number of Trips 1-3 -0.00435 ## 3 Number of Trips 3-5 -0.00330 ## 4 Number of Trips 5-10 -0.00739 ## 5 Number of Trips 10-25 -0.0106 ## 6 Number of Trips 25-50 0.00273 ## 7 Number of Trips &gt;= 50 0.00882 The perc_change column is calculated by using the percentage before the pandemic minus the percentage after the pandemic. Hence the negative value indicates the percentage decreases and a positive value indicate that the percentage increases. The calculation first proved our observation that the percentage of trips longer than 50 miles increases and the percentage of trips between 1-3 miles decreases. Furthermore, the calculation shows that actually the percentage for middle distance trips (i.e. trips from 1-25 miles) decreased, but for short and long distance trips (i.e. below 1 mile or above 25 miles) increased. Combining with some real-world experience, one of the reasons for the decreasing in middle distance trips is that the middle trip distances includes daily commutes from home to office and some entertain activities like going to shopping malls or movie theaters. During pandemic, such activities is no longer available due to certain regulations hence the opportunities for people making middle-distance trips decreases. Short distance trips include the situation where people drive to the supermarket to buy groceries and this kind of need increases since people stay at home all day and need to buy fresh groceries more frequently. The extreme long distance trips contains the scenarios where people drive to their family members’ house, or go back to hometown. This need also increases since more people decided to go back home from big cities. Therefore, the changes in the percentages are reasonable and explainable after second thoughts and is a very interesting finding that we are not expecting from the beginning. 5.3 Multiple Cleveland dot plot: number of trips before and after pandemic in state level After having an idea about how the number of trips changes in the national level, we would like to go into the state level to see how the averaged number of trips change before and after the pandemic for each state. We select the averaged trip number from 2019-04-01 to 2020-03-13 as the averaged trip number before pandemic and take the averaged number from 2020-03-13 to 2021-03-20 as the one after the pandemic. As a result, we present the multiple Cleveland dot plot, where the averaged daily number of trips change before and after the pandemic for each state is displayed and the order of the state is sorted according to the number of averaged trip numbers before the pandemic. Some observations can be made based on the above graph. The first and foremost one is that for all states, the averaged number of trips after the pandemic is less than the value before. It means that people’s mobility level decreased regardless of the state. The plot also shows that the states with top five trip numbers before pandemic are CA, TX, NY, FL, IL, which are also top five states with most trips after pandemic. 5.4 Scatterplot: Overview of Transportation and CovID-19 In order to take a close look at relationship between transportation and pandemic, we draw a scatterplot of daily number of trips and confirmed cases in a national wide range (2020-01-23 ~ 2021-02-01). By first drawing a boxplot of confirmed cases (omitted here), we only keep the interquantile range. We could read information that when there are more confirmed cases, fewer people will travel out, which conforms to our common sense. However, the tendency is not that obvious. From the scatterplot, it seems that people’s willingness to travelling is not largely affected by epidemic situation. 5.5 Map: Percent of people staying at home during COVID-19 pandemic. After reviewing trip numbers and COVID-19 confirmed cases at the national level, our study drills down to the state level by showing state level home quarantine statistics on a map. The map of the United States represents the average percentage of people who stayed at home after the outbreak (March 13, 2019) of the pandemic. The monochromatic color scheme was chosen to represent percentage values, with darker color representing higher percentage. This chart provides a clear view of contrast to both adjacent states and states that are farther apart, providing rich information to help compare home quarantine rates, therefore creating a holistic view of our analysis. To a closer look at the chart, NY, CA and AK are among the states with highest percentage of people staying at home. From our previous analysis, NY and CA are among the top 5 states with the most averaged number of trips after the pandemic. Even though these two results may seems like a conflict at first glance, however, it may because that the number of trips is also correlated with the number of populations in the state. NY and CA have relatively higher population density among the states, thus it is not strange that they have more number of trips even if the quarantine percentages are the top two among all states. 5.6 Heatmap of people going out in each state After a glance at how much people quarantine in each state, we want to see further how this portion changes as time passes by. We use a heatmap to show average proportion of people travelling out of each state monthly. 50 states are put on the y-axis and 15 months are on the x-axis (2019/12~2021/02). A lot of information could be fetched from this plot! Some states on the top of heatmap almost ignore the quarantine advocacy, such as Mississippi, Alabama and Arkansas, where proportion of people going out merely decreases during pandemic. Some common features of these states are that the number of confirmed cases is not very high and population density is also comparatively low. Number of trips of most states significantly drops during two periods of pandemic (April 2020 and Winter 2020). It is also interesting that the lower right part of the heatmap is quite light, implying that people in these states are customed to staying at home (like Work From Home) even when epidemic situation is ameliorated. What’s more, the three states with most confirmed cases are California, Texas and New York sequently. However, their anti-epidemic measures seems quite different since California and New York are among the states with least proportion of people travelling while percent of travelers is still high in Texas. 5.7 Ridgeline plot of daily new cases For reference, we put the weekly averaged new confirmed cases of five states with most cases in a ridgeline plot. We can see that first peek of cases in New Yrok is much earlier than other states. Compared with California and New York, the ridge of Taxes is more continuous in the sense that it has never reached a valley (minimum) in the last 10 months. 5.8 Treemap for top five COVID-19 severe states This interactive treemap provides another view of transportation patterns for the 5 states with most confirmed COVID-19 cases. Each state was represented by a large rectangle, with a unique color. Within each state, the number of trips was further broken out by small rectangles, providing a more granular view of transportation distance statistics. Thus, this treemap shows muti-layer of comparison in an efficient way by comparing trip information across states and by area of each rectangle indicating proportional volume of each dimension. Together with other charts, the treemap provides a nice summary of trip volumes under the pandemic. The top five states with most severe COVID-19 situation are California, Texas, New York, Florida and Illinois. This treemap shows trip information after the pandemic outbreak. It is an interactive Treemap so you can click on the specific state and see a detailed Treemap! Errands under 1 mile and small distance trips between 1 - 3 miles accounted for the majority of trips for the states with most confirmed cases. We can also find out that the total number of trips has contribution to total cases. 5.9 Alluvial chart showing type of travelling in terms of distance Here we use two alluvial diagrams to show distributions of trips of different lengths in California, New Yor and Texas, separately before (before 2020/03/13) and after (after 2020/03/13) COVID-19 breaks out. We define trips of length between 0 to 5 miles as short trips; 5 to 50 miles as medium trips and longer than 50 miles as long trips. From these two figures, the rough dividing of short, medium and long remain the same as before pandemic, where most trips are short ones. And we can read that proportion of people travelling out increases in Texas in these three states, as we have already learned before. What’s more, we also don’t see a decrease in proportion of long-distance trips in these three states. It is an interesting finding that when people taking care of themselves by decreasing numbers of going out nearby, they don’t necessarily avoid long-term trips. 5.10 Boxplot of Trip numbers for each county in Texas As we have detected Texas as an unusual state ftom analysis above, we decide to explore more about it! We draw a boxplot of number of short trips in 10 counties with most frequent activities. As we can see, number of short-term travellers is far ahead in Harris County, where the medium is about 6.5 millions. Harris County is the most populous county in Texas and the third most populous county in the US, where Houston lies in. Harris is also the fifth top county of confirmed cases (news statistics from Johns Hopkins University). "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component As we find that long-distance trips aren’t decreasing as much as other types, we decide to lend D3 to explore more on such kind of trips. Here we use dataset2 containing monthly statistics of some transportation methods suitable for long journeys, such as airline and railway. First, we present an animated bar chart demonstrating comparison of total ridership of each method. The initial blue ones represent amounts in the 10 months before outbreak of COVID-19 (2019/05~2020/02) and pink ones for the next 10 months (2020/03~2020/12). With such an animation, we can see how drastically people’s use of public transportation drops. Something special here is that we also include the last two groups (Freight Rail-Intermodal Units (in millions) and Freight Rail-Carloads (in millions)) as a side fact to see how freight transportation changes during pandemic. Interestingly, from the plot we can tell that effct of COVID-19 on freight is not as large as that on our daily travelling life. What’s more, by hovering on the bar you are interested in, you could see the specific number! Another thing about this chart is that comparison among different categories is not meaningful. Since dimension of each category is not on the same level, we rescale each category to produce this bar chart. For example, Airline is measure in 10 millions while ridership is in 100 millions. Please be aware of this while reading! For reference, this chart is developed following the tutorial here. svg{ border: solid 1px #222; } svg > g.chart > rect.bar{ fill: pink; stroke-width: 1px; stroke: #444; transition: fill 300ms; } svg > g.chart > rect.bar.new{ fill: aliceblue; } svg > g.chart > rect.bar.obs{ fill: tomato; } svg > g.chart > rect.bar.highlight{ fill: gold; stroke-width: 4px; } With D3, we also build a line chart with filter, through which we could choose a transportation method to see its time series over the 10 months. By functioning it as an interactive map, this would reduce a lot of area than in a static one and make us more focused on each plot. From this plot, we can get a more intuitive impression of how airline shrinks and how stable the freight traffic is. Please also be aware of the different scale here! The measure of each category is slightly different from last section: Airline-International and Airline-Domestic are in 0.1 millions; Ridership - Fixed Route Bus and Ridership - Urban Rail are in millions; Freight-Rail Intermodal Units and Freight-Rail Carloads are in 10 thousands. And this part is developed from d3 gallery. "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion 7.1 Main findings 7.2 Lessons learned 7.3 Limitations and future directions", " Chapter 7 Conclusion 7.1 Main findings The main finding is that the COVID-19 pandemic greatly decreased the number of travelings. Since the trips are divided into ten granular level by distance, we find that the percentage of middle-distance trips with 1-25 miles decreased, but the percentage of short trip with less than 1 mile and long distance trips with more than 25 miles increased, which is the result that we did not expected before examining the data. We further drills down to the state level and find the top five states where people like to move around is CA, TX, NY, FL and IL and this rank remains the same before and after the pandemic. We also investigated the relationship between the COVID-19 confirmed case and daily number of trips. We find that when there are more confirmed cases, fewer people will travel out, which conforms to our common sense. However, the tendency is subtle, which suggests that people’s willingness to traveling is not largely affected by pandemic. What’s more, the usages of airplane (both international and domestic), bus, and rail all have been drastically decreasing during the pandemic. One interesting finding is that the usages of freight rail, though also decreased during the COVID-19, the amount decrements is not as much as those in human traveling. 7.2 Lessons learned We find that different data sources contributes to some interesting findings that could not be achieved by a single dataset. We relate COVID-19 data to trip and transportation to see the pandemic from a different perspective, that is to see to what extent the pandemic impacted people’s traveling behaviors with various transportation methods and the relationship between different variables. Our analysis helps to see the impact of COVID-19 on a larger social scale, which drew many interesting findings as mentioned above. Also, we discover that correctly selecting graph types to make visualizations is very important. Each graph has its own features and we need to choose the ones that are most helpful to our goal. Meanwhile, combining different types of graphs also enhances our understanding and analysis to the whole dataset. Thus in our study, we used ten different graphs, and each one of them provides unique insights and inspires us in its own way. 7.3 Limitations and future directions Some analysis is not investigated in so much detail because of time limit. For example, in the national-level number of trips plot, there is a surge on the number of trip around March 2020. We did not fully explore the reason why that was the case with other supporting data or documents. In addition, due to the limitation columns in the COVID-19 dataset, we mainly focused on the number of confirmed cases. However, we think it will be interesting to investigate how the vaccine process is impacting people’s trip and transportation behaviors. It could be a start point for future analysis. "]]
